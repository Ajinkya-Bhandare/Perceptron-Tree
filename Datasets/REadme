SONAR DATASET
This is a dataset that describes sonar chirp returns bouncing off different services. 
The 60 input variables are the strength of the returns at different angles. 
It is a binary classification problem that requires a model to differentiate rocks from metal cylinders.
The output variable is a string “M” for mine and “R” for rock, which will need to be converted to integers 1 and 0.
